                <p>I wish you were here with me<br>
                    walking on the beach in Hawaii<br>
                    playing on the golden sand<br>
                    looking at the ocean now I understand<br>
                    love is like the open sea<br>
                    and I wish you were here with me<br>
                    on the beach in Hawaii<br>
                </p>

                <p>since you've been gone away<br>
                    I think about you everyday<br>
                    don't you know I miss you much<br>
                    and you know I need your touch<br>
                    I'm on a rocky cliff,<br>
                    oh I wish you were here with me<br>
                    on the beach in Hawaii<br>
                </p>

                <p>a little pakalolo, and I say mahalo<br>
                    ujjayi breathing<br>
                    to get a real feeling<br>
                    Yogi gonna let you know<br>
                    that I wish you were here with me<br>
                    on the beach in Hawaii<br>
                    in Hawaii<br>
                </p>

                <p>a little pakalolo, and I say mahalo<br>
